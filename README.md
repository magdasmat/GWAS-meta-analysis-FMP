## Contents
- **Scripts**: Code used for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **Figures**: Graphs and plots generated during the analysis.
- **Tables**: Data tables and summary statistics.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to identify genetic variants associated with aPTT through a comprehensive meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 

## Usage
The scripts and data provided here are intended for reproducibility and further analysis. Feel free to explore and adapt the material for related studies or projects.
